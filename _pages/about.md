About Me
======
<h2 style="background-color: #f4f4f4; margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 10px; color: #FF9999; background: #FFFFFF;">I will be in Santiago, Chile in June for SIGMOD 2024!</h2>

I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in the School of Computer Science and Technology at **Huazhong University of Science and Technology** ([**HUST**](https://www.hust.edu.cn/)), advised by Prof. [**Yao Wan**](http://wanyao.me/). I am a member of the CGCL laboratory led by Prof. [**Hai Jin**](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=o02W0aEAAAAJ&hl=en).

I am actively seeking a PhD position in SE/ML/HCI for 2025 fall.    
Youâ€™re welcome to download my **CV** [here](../assets/YangWu_CV.pdf) and **Transcript** [here](../assets/Transcript.pdf).

Research Interests
======
<!-- My primary research interest lies in code intelligence, including code summarization and code generation, with a specific focus on natural language to visualization (NL2Vis). I am particularly interested in leveraging AI in the applications of tabular data and visualization. -->
My primary research interest lies in the intersection between Software Engineering and Human-Computer Interaction, including source code generation and summarization, with a specific focus on the universality of natural language, source code and data visualizations with AI tools.
